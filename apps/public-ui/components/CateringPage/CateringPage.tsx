          To make your catering arrangements, we ask our charter guests to
          contact our partners directly. This will prevent confusion and give
          you control over verification and payment. As always, we are happy to
          to answer any questions or concerns regarding your catering plans for
          the charter.

            We've collaborated with private Chef Mari Jo Ramie to offer a custom
            menu for your sail around Charleston Harbor. Through her locally renowned
            catering outfit, Marjoram Cuisine, she offers a wide selection of southern
            classics, decadent seafood mains, and fresh, modern snacks and desserts. For
            an added fee, invite Chef Mari along for the sail so she can prep, clean,
            and take everything down after so you donâ€™t have to lift a finger!
