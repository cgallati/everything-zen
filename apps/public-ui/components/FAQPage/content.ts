    question: 'what is the cancellation policy?',
    answer:
      'Guest may cancel up to 48 hours before the charter at no cost. Cancellations by the guest with less than 48 hours notice will result in the full charter amount being charged to the payment method on file. Cancellations made by the Captain for weather reasons will not result in a charge to the customer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the weather stinks?',
    answer:
      'Sailing is an outdoor sport and the captain watches the weather closely on sailing days. It’s rare to have to cancel or post pone due to weather but the captain will discuss with the guest in advance if needed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can we stay protected from the sun?',
    answer:
      'We have great shaded indoor (with ample windows) and outdoor spaces for your flexibility and comfort. Don’t forget your sunscreen when spending time on the bow, but leave the spray/aerosol sunscreens at home please as they stain boat surfaces. And hang onto your hat if you bring one!',

    question: 'Is the charter safe?',
    answer:
      'The vessel has passed an on-site coast guard safety inspection and has advanced radar, VHF and AIS technology. We have adult and kids sized PFDs. It is recommended that small Children wear a PFD when on deck. Please let us know in advance of children’s weights to ensure proper sizing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we stop and swim?',
    answer:
      'Yes! This is possible, weather and tidal current dependent. Keep in mind that it will shorten our sailing time.',

    question: 'Should I tip the sailing team?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I bring more than 6 passengers?',
    answer:
      'No. The coast guard limits this class of charter vessel to 6 passengers, not including the captain and crew. Even small children count. However, it may be possible to accommodate your party on two vessels by partnering with another charter, depending on availability.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I get sea sick?',
    answer:
      'Given our large stable boat and the protected waters of the harbor, motion sickness is very rare. Please let the captain know if one of the passengers is susceptible to motion sickness and we can concentrate our sailing area in the most protective portions of the harbor.',
