        <Paragraph>
          After years of sailing around the Caribbean & Southeast with family
          and friends, Captain Todd Gallati believes that the experience of
          sailing needs to be shared. Above all, we value experiences with
          family and friends, and we know you do too.

          while underway. This gives you peace-of-mind so you can turn your full
